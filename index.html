          Hello you beautiful social butterfly, welcome to Safe space (depending on who you are)

          <h4>Code of conduct</h4>
          <p>
            This is a place for people to socialise. Here we would like to pretend we are very
            inclusive and accomodating so you will be blocked if you make us look otherwise. We
            would like to create a safe space for people like us. We have no objective criteria for
            what it means to be like us so the best way to find out if you are not like us is if you
            have been blocked. To ensure you have a great time here, we STRONGLY but of course
            gentry recommend that you:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Do not express you opinions if they are not in line with the majority view</li>
            <li>Be vague with where you stand on controversial issues</li>
            <li>Put being PC above having a sense of humour, and a personality</li>
          </ol>
